  <h1><u>Keeper of the Lost Cities</u></h1>

  <h2><u>My Theories</u></h2>
    <ul>
<li>Sophies biological dad is Elwin Hesledge, my reasons:<br>
    1.He cares for Sophie a <b>LOT</b>(eg. The night Sophie 
    burnt herself and hailed elwin, he went there immediately 
    even though he didn't inow her that well) <br>
    2. He and Master Leto(AKA Forkle) were talking in the 
    healing center at some point in everblaze, which is kinda
    suspicious <br>
    3. Why did he give della a sophie survival kit 
    in neverseen? <br>
    4. He and oralie donâ€˜t know each other that well and Sophieâ€˜s 
    biological parents donâ€˜t have a lot of contact. <br>
    5. Forkle made it very clear that he canâ€˜t tell Sophie who her
    mother is(because Oralie is a Councilor, but he didnâ€˜t say much
    about her father which means the father isn't that important.
</li>
<li>
    Alden and Terik are with the Neverseen(this theory includes help from some other people)<br>
    WARNING SPOILERS FOR BOOK 4<br>
    1. I realised that Councillor Terik can sense someones potential 
    for good or bad in an elf. And we know that Terik took a 
    reading of Alvar at some point so shouldn't he have known that 
    alvar was bad? And if he knew then why didn't he tell anyone?
    And also could it be that Terik doesn't even have an ability,
    because he is the only Descryer or he claims to be, so maybe 
    he doesn't have an ability and is just lying about it to be 
    in the council and is actually a member of the neverseen? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±<br>
    2. Terik also helped Sophie with her guilt in book 2 when 
    Aldens mind was broken. Why would a Councillor do that?<br>
    3. This means Terik could have stepped in to spy on Sophie, 
    because Alden always asked questions about things.<br>
    4. This also explains why Alden sentenced Prentice to mind break.<br>
    5. In Flashback Alden doesn't want anyone to search his office
    this could be personal reasons or he was hiding something that
    connected him to the Neverseen.
</li>
<li>
    Tinker is Jolie Ruewen(Grady and Edalines daughter)<br>
    1. She covers her face which means it could have been burnt 
    in the fire <br>
    2. She is scared of fire and anything hot just like brant <br>
    3. Her voice is raspy which could be from the fire <br>
    4. Forkle doesnâ€˜t know who she is(keeps her identity very secret)<br>
    5. She has a gremlin and Jolie and Brant met while shopping for 
    a gremlin!!!
</li>
<li>
    Blurs identity(I have a few theories and i will list them here)<br>
    <u>Theory Number 1:</u><br>
    Jensis brother:<br>
    1. Jensi said his brother is a Phaser and so is Blur.<br>
    2. Sophie said thought Blur had a familiar, round shaped face
    just like Jensi.<br>
    <u>Theory Number 2</u>(this theory isn't mine it's from a friend<br>
    Councillor Darek:<br>
    1. Blur has thin lips and something interesting about his cheeks 
    remind me of Darek.<br>
    2. He is a Phaser
    3. The chance that the whole Collective and all Councillors are 
    in the same room is very likely.
</li>
<li>
    Brants last name is Fathdon(Kenric Fathdon):<br>
    1. Elvin siblings often have a similar middle. Kenrics is Elgar
    and Brants is Alger.
    2. Both middle names are anagrams of regal. Kenric is regal and Brant
    is jealous of him and he wants to get revenge by joining the Neverseen
</li>
    </ul>
